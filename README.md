# TriviaGameAdvanced

This is an advanced version of the Trivia Game.

Instead of having set buttons, I will create a clickable div fields for the answer that will change color and add a border when the user hovers over them.

The screen will switch when an answer is selected or when the timer runs out and show the correct answer (with an image maybe). After a few seconds, the screen will move onto the next question without user input.

After all the questions have been answered, there will be a button to reset(not reload! Why? Because that's why) the page. Additionally, on that page it will show the stats of the answers.
